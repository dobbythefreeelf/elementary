## Want to chat?

We have opened the [#gentoo-pantheon](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=gentoo-pantheon) channel on the Freenode IRC network. This is NOT a place to report issues (go [here](https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary/issues) for that), but it is a place for community to gather and discussion to take place.
